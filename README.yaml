  This project is supported by the [Datadog Open Source Program](https://www.datadoghq.com/partner/open-source/).

  As part of this collaboration, Datadog provides a dedicated sandbox account that we use for automated integration and acceptance testing. This contribution allows us to continuously validate changes against a real Datadog environment, improving reliability and reducing the risk of regressions.

  We are grateful to Datadog for supporting our open source ecosystem and helping ensure that infrastructure code for Terraform remains stable and well-tested

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  To enable Datadog forwarder for RDS Enhanced monitoring:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_rds_enabled = true
  }
  ```

  To enable Datadog forwarder for a CloudTrail S3 bucket:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_log_enabled = true
    s3_buckets            = ["cloudtrail-audit-bucket"]
    s3_bucket_kms_arns    = ["arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:1234567890:key/b204f3d2-1111-2222-94333332-4444ccc222"]
  }
  ```

  To enable Datadog forwarder for a S3 bucket with prefix:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_log_enabled = true
    s3_buckets_with_prefixes = {
      MyBucketWithPrefix = {bucket_name = "my-bucket-with-prefix", bucket_prefix = "events/"}
      AnotherWithPrefix  = {bucket_name = "another-with-prefix", bucket_prefix = "records/"}
    }
    s3_bucket_kms_arns       = ["arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:1234567890:key/b204f3d2-1111-2222-94333332-4444ccc222"]
  }
  ```

  To enable Datadog forwarder for RDS authentication CloudWatch logs:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_log_enabled = true
    cloudwatch_forwarder_log_groups = {
      postgres = {
        name           = "/aws/rds/cluster/pg-main/postgresql"
        filter_pattern = ""
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  To enable Datadog forwarder for VPC Flow Logs CloudWatch logs:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_vpc_logs_enabled   = true
    vpclogs_cloudwatch_log_group = "/aws/vpc/flowlogs/vpc1"
  }
  ```

  To use a local copy of the lambda code you can specify the artifact url:
  ```hcl
  module "datadog_lambda_forwarder" {
    source = "cloudposse/datadog-lambda-forwarder/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    forwarder_rds_enabled      = true
    forwarder_rds_artifact_url = file("${path.module}/function.zip")
  }
  ```
